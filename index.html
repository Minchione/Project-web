      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="pgraph">The term "retrogaming" has gained increasing popularity in the last two decades.<br>
          Retrogaming refers to the hobby of enjoying, replaying or otherwise rediscovering
          <span class="strikethrough">outdated</span> ancient videogames or hardware (be it consoles or retrocomputers, emulators or o.g. hardware).
          However, while retrogaming is a hobby for most people, it is a <strong><i>very</i></strong> serious passion or calling for others.
          Some people dedicate their whole life and soul to retrogaming, contributing to the community
          with brilliant pieces of modern day software, hardware and arts.
          Preservation is one important aspect of retrogaming: thanks to the rise of emulators, jumping in the hobby
          has never been easier.
          When referring to ancient personal computers, we make an important distinction.
          Retrocomputing is the branch of retro enthusiasts that keep the "ZX Spectrum VS. C64" rant
          alive, arguing over which computer did it better even though the eighties ended well over three decades ago. Well...maybe that is not the most
          appropriate definition, but the matter of fact is a retrogamer may not necessarily be
          into retrocomputing and, consequently, a retrocomputing enthusiast may not necessarily
          be into retrogaming, even though these two branches seem to cross for most people in the field.</div>

          <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="pgraph">The first resemblance of a videogame dates back to the late fourties. A more inexpert one might think of the first videogame as Pong, but that actually came out in 1972. It might surprise you that this a commonly discussed and rather controversial or debatable topic for historians and enthusiasts alike. We first have to define what a videogame is in the first place. A videogame is a type of electronic game whose players' interactions through an input device are directly displayed on a screen. Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr invented the "Cathode-ray tube amusement device" in 1947, the earliest known interactive electronic game, controlled by the player by adjusting knobs to change the trajectory of a CRT beam spot on the display in order to reach plastic targets overlaid on the screen. However, this cannot be qualified as a "videogame" because it is not really a game per se. The machine relied on oscilloscope-based technology of the era (the same kind used by the navy and commonly found on sonars and radars). Later, in 1950, a computer game called Bertie the Brain was invented by Josef Kates for the Canadian National Exhibition. It was a giant four meter computer that allowed attendees to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against artificial intelligence. However, it displayed the action via light bulbs rather than a screen with visual graphics. Where the cathode-ray tube abusement device lacked the game, Bertie the Brain lacked the video. This poses a problem for historians as to what can actually be classified as one, but if you ask experts, you will find the general consensus exists: Tennis for Two.</div>

            <div class="pgraph">Perhaps the first ever game created purely for entertainment purposes rather than academical research or product innovation is Tennis for Two, also known as Computer Tennis. It is a sports video game that simulates a game of tennis, and was one of the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game in 1958 for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button. Tennis for Two was a hit in the museum during the three-day exhibition with players lining up to see the game, especially high school students. It was shown again the following year with a larger oscilloscope screen and a more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels. It was then dismantled and largely forgotten until the late 1970s when Higinbotham testified in court about the game during lawsuits between Magnavox and Ralph H. Baer over video game patents.</div>

          <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="pgraph">Meet Ralph H. Baer. Widely remembered as "the Father of Video Games", Ralph was a German-American inventor, game developer, and engineer. Baer's family fled Germany just before World War II and Baer served the American war effort, gaining an interest in electronics shortly thereafter. Ralph was a true visionary as he first patented an apparatus "for the generation, display, manipulation, and use of symbols or geometric figures upon the screen of the television receivers for the purpose of training simulation, for playing games, and for engaging in other activities by one or more participants". Through several jobs in the electronics industry, he was working as an engineer at Sanders Associates (now BAE Systems) in Nashua, NH, when he conceived the idea of playing games on a television screen around 1966. With support of his employers, he worked through several prototypes until he arrived at a "Brown Box" that would later become the blueprint for the first home video game console, licensed by Magnavox as the Magnavox Odyssey. The Odyssey would later see commercial release in 1972.</div>
